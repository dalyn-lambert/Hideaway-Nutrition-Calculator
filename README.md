Calculate the nutrition information for your meal at Hideaway Pizza.

## Visit the Site

## Overview

The Hideaway Nutrition Calculator is built in Next.js and allows a user to view the macros of their meal. The site retrieves nutritional information from local JSON files and displays the data to the user. Currently the Build Your Own Pizza, Sandwhiches, Pasta, Dessets, Drinks, and Kid's Menu sections of the Hideaway menu are implemented.

I use Notion to keep track of to dos and bugs as well as to track my time spent coding. [Click here](https://dalyn-lambert.notion.site/7c81a0c1639c4b6f91a867dedb75a9cc) to check out my Notion page for this project.

## What's Next

- Implement the remaining menu sections: Specialy Pizzas, Salads, Starters
- Improve mobile design
